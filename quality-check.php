	During the process of knitting, a sample sock is hung on the machine, utilized as a reference for the other socks. This sample sock has been approved for a specified color, size and design. The technicians in charge, then, ensure every sock manufactured comprises of these exact specifications. The technicians also inspect for the quality of the knitting by  measuring the different dimensions to compare with the original.<br><br>

QC personnel continuously check each machine at least once every four hours with the sock tester machine to confirm the length, width and stretch parameters of the socks.<br><br>

Prior to batch production, a few socks are manufactured on each of the machines to assure the manufactured socks are of identical size, weight, color, design, etc. Upon the head technician's approval, we begin producing them in bulk.

	After hand linking and rosso linking, the lose threads are removed and the seam is analyzed for fineness before the socks are passed on for the next stage of production.<br><br>

Our socks are also checked while they are on the boarding machine. Any socks that are not up to the quality standards are removed. The socks then go for pairing and at this stage are again checked before they are approved to go to the packaging department.<br><br>

The raw materials used in the packing of the socks such as labels, band roles, stickers and hangers are checked with regard to our quality parameters. Here the socks are again checked for all the quality parameters including measurements, color assortments, labeling and barcoding to guarantee the socks are meeting all the customers' specifications and are of the highest quality. <br><br>

After the socks/boxes are packed there is a final random check of 5% of the boxes. This is done by the QC personnel who are trained to act like they represent the buyer. Keeping the buyers interests in mind they have the power to override other employees in the company with regards to the approval of goods before dispatch.
